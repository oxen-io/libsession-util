///
/// Constructs a group info config object and sets a pointer to it in `conf`.
///
/// When done with the object the `config_object` must be destroyed by passing the pointer to
/// config_free() (in `session/config/base.h`).
///
/// Inputs:
/// - `conf` -- [out] Pointer to the config object
/// - `ed25519_pubkey` -- [in] 32-byte pointer to the group's public key
/// - `ed25519_secretkey` -- [in] optional 64-byte pointer to the group's secret key
///   (libsodium-style 64 byte value).  Pass as NULL for a non-admin member.
/// - `dump` -- [in] if non-NULL this restores the state from the dumped byte string produced by a
/// past instantiation's call to `dump()`.  To construct a new, empty object this should be NULL.
/// - `dumplen` -- [in] the length of `dump` when restoring from a dump, or 0 when `dump` is NULL.
/// - `error` -- [out] the pointer to a buffer in which we will write an error string if an error
/// occurs; error messages are discarded if this is given as NULL.  If non-NULL this must be a
/// buffer of at least 256 bytes.
///
/// Outputs:
/// - `int` -- Returns 0 on success; returns a non-zero error code and write the exception message
/// as a C-string into `error` (if not NULL) on failure.
