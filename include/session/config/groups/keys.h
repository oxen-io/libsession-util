/// Inputs:
/// - `conf` -- [in] Pointer to the config object
/// - `ciphertext_in` -- [in] Pointer to a data buffer containing the encrypted data (as was
///   produced by `groups_keys_encrypt_message`).
/// - `ciphertext_len` -- [in] Length of `ciphertext_in`
/// - `session_id_out` -- [out] pointer to a buffer of at least 67 bytes where the null-terminated,
///   hex-encoded session_id of the message's author will be written if decryption/verification was
///   successful.
/// - `plaintext_out` -- [out] Pointer-pointer to an output buffer; a new buffer is allocated, the
///   decrypted/decompressed data written to it, and then the pointer to that buffer is stored here.
///   This buffer must be `free()`d by the caller when done with it *unless* the function returns
///   false, in which case the buffer pointer will not be set.
/// - `plaintext_len` -- [out] Pointer to a size_t where the length of `plaintext_out` is stored.
///   Not touched if the function returns false.
///
/// Outputs:
/// - `bool` -- True if the message was successfully decrypted, false if decryption (or parsing or
///   decompression) failed with all of our known keys.  If (and only if) true is returned then
///   `plaintext_out` must be freed when done with it.  If false is returned then `conf.last_error`
///   will contain a diagnostic message describing why the decryption failed.
