/// This "config" isn't exactly a regular config type that inherits from ConfigBase; in particular:
/// - it doesn't encrypt the message (but merely contains encrypted elements within it)
/// - it doesn't merge
/// - it does have a concept analogous to the message seqno
/// - conflict resolution involves regenerating and distributing new keys; nothing gets merged.
/// - it cares strongly about when new configs were pushed (configs expire after having been
///   replaced for a certain amount of time, not by being updated).
/// - its internal state isn't fully serialized when pushing updates
/// - messages don't contain the outer layer of config messages (where config metadata, references
///   to other objects, etc.) that ConfigBase-derived type hold.
/// - it isn't compressed (since most of the data fields are encrypted or random, compression
///   reduction would be minimal).
///
/// Fields used (in ascii order):
/// # -- 24-byte nonce used for all the encrypted values in this message; required.
///
/// For non-supplemental messages:
///
/// G -- monotonically incrementing counter identifying key generation changes
/// K -- encrypted copy of the key for admins (omitted for `+` incremental key messages)
/// k -- packed bytes of encrypted keys for non-admin members; this is a single byte string in which
///      each 48 bytes is a separate encrypted value.
///
/// For supplemental messages:
/// + -- encrypted supplemental key info list; this is a list of encrypted values, encrypted for
///      each member to whom keys are being disclosed.  The *decrypted* value of these entries are
///      the same value (encrypted separately for each member) which is a bt-encoded list of dicts
///      where each dict contains keys:
///      - g -- the key generation
///      - k -- the key itself (32 bytes).
///      - t -- the storage timestamp of the key (so that recipients know when keys expire)
/// G -- the maximum generation of the keys included in this message; this is used to track when
///      this message can be allowed to expire.
///
/// And finally, for both types:
///
/// ~ -- signature of the message signed by the group's master keypair, signing the message value up
///      to but not including the ~ keypair.  The signature must be the last key in the dict (thus
///      `~` since it is the largest 7-bit ascii character value).  Note that this signature
///      mechanism works exactly the same as the signature on regular config messages.
///
/// Some extra details:
///
/// - each copy of the encryption key uses xchacha20_poly1305 using the `#` nonce
/// - the `k` members list gets padded with junk entries up to the next multiple of 75 (for
///   non-supplemental messages).
/// - the decryption key for the admin version of the key is H(admin_seed,
///   key="SessionGroupKeyAdmin")
/// - the encryption key for a member is H(a'B || A' || B, key="SessionGroupKeyMember") where a'/A'
///   is the group Ed25519 master key converted to X25519, and b/B is the member's X25519 keypair
///   (i.e. B is the non-05-prefixed session_id).
///   - the decryption key is calculated by the member using `bA' || A' || B`
/// - A new key and nonce is created from a 56-byte H(M0 || M1 || ... || Mn || g || S,
///   key="SessionGroupKeyGen"), where S = H(group_seed, key="SessionGroupKeySeed").
